# CIFAR-10 Image Classification CNN Model
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented using TensorFlow/Keras for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

The CNN model implemented in this project is trained on the CIFAR-10 training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset. It achieves 80% accuracy on the test set.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset is included with the TensorFlow/Keras library and can be easily loaded using their API. However, you can also obtain the dataset from the CIFAR-10 website.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
